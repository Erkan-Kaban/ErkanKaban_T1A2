                <p>Currently studying at Coder Academy on a journey of knowledge on how web pages form together, I am looking forward to
                    the future, I have gained knowledge through my years on just the basics such as in Java, C#, Javascript and of course web
                    design, I look forward to furthering my knowledge and other code languages. Learning at a accelerated pace definitely seems
                    daunting however, once you break down things into daily tasks it would surprise you how much gets done.

                <h1>Machine Operator</h1>
                <p>Working in a mighty biscuit factory, full of sweet tasting biscuits sure felt the real life version of willy wonka! Working here my 
                    responsibility consisted of Disassembling/Reassembling, cleaning, setting and operating machinery. Once the machine was up and running,
                    it was my duty to monitor and maintain biscuits at a certain weight and dimension, minimise wastage and communication and team work were also
                    important.

                <h1>Water Jet Operator</h1>
                <p>Working in a carton factory as popular as Visy was a pleasure, my responsibility mainly consisted of setting up and operating
                    machine tools to manufacture precision metal parts, instruments and tools, I also operated a water jet machine that required
                    precise Auto-Cad design in order to cut the necessary components to fit a mould that would operate on big machines that would 
                    cut millions of boxes throughout its life.

                <h3>Qantas<br> Jan 2010 - Feb 2016 </h3>
                <h1>Aircraft Maintenance Engineer</h1>
                <p>Working for Qantas was one of my biggest personal careers, it invovled lots of study, resilience and hard work. Four years completing
                    an apprenticeship travelling to Avalon in Victoria all the way to Brisbane to gain experience in the work field was like none other.
                    Throughout my apprenticeship and tradesman period, work mainly involved lots of assembling, inspecting, testing various mechanical 
                    components, problem solving and fault finding, understanding mechanical drawings and instructions. All of this gave me the Experience
                    to have great mechanical mindset and improved written and verbal communication.

                <h3>Woolworths <br> Feb 2007 - Jan 2010</h3>
                <h1>Front End</h1>
                <p>Working here at a younger age taught me several social skills as well and reponsibility and being punctual. Most of the experience gain
                    was revolved around customer service and verbal communication. Resolving any issues a customer might have or assisting them in finding
                    the item they were after, as well as remembering the shop back to front to fill isles with products as well as setup the way shelves 
                    would look visually aesthetic was important to gain customers attention, attention to detail was also imporntant.
